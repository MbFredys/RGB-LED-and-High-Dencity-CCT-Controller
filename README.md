This is a compact high‑density LED strip controller PCB design that enables professional‑grade control of RGB and CCT lighting with the following features:

1. 🎛️ Drives 5 independent channels (RGB + Warm White + Cool White) up to 2A each  
2. 📶 WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity via **ESP32‑C3‑WROOM‑02** microcontroller  
3. 🔌 USB‑C connector for programming and optional 5V logic power input  
4. ⚡ Efficient **LM2678T‑ADJ** buck converter (12V → 5V) for RGB LED supply  
5. 🔋 Stable **TPS7A20 LDO** (5V → 3.3V) for ESP32 logic power  
6. 🔒 Robust protection with polyfuse, Schottky diodes, and TVS surge suppressors  
7. 🔧 Low‑side switching with **IRLZ44N MOSFETs** for reliable high‑current control  
8. 🔗 Dedicated connectors: 4‑pin (5V, R, G, B) and 3‑pin (12V, CW, WW) for LED strips  
9. 🛡️ Ground separation using **Net‑Tie** between GND_PWR and GND_LOGIC for noise isolation  

## Usage

To use the RGB+CCT LED controller, follow these steps:

1. Connect a **12V / 5A power supply** to the input connector  
2. Plug LED strips into the 4‑pin RGB (5V) and/or 3‑pin CCT (12V) outputs  
3. Program the ESP32‑C3 via the **USB‑C** port  
4. Configure WiFi/Bluetooth for wireless control  
5. Send PWM commands to adjust brightness and color temperature in real time  

The device ensures stable operation with efficient power conversion and robust protection, making it suitable for smart lighting, architectural projects, and IoT‑based illumination systems.
